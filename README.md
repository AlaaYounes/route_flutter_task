# Product Display Screen

This README provides an overview of the ProductDisplayScreen in our Flutter application, showcasing
how it displays a list of beauty products to the user.

## Features

**Product Listing**: Displays a grid of products, each with an image, name, price, and review
rating.  
**Product Details**: Each product card includes the product's image, name, current price, original
price and a review rating.

## Usage

**Viewing Products**: The screen displays products in a grid format, allowing users to easily browse
through available items.

## Customization

**Data Source**: Update the product data source to fetch information from an API.

## Example Scenario

In an e-commerce application for beauty products, the ProductDisplayScreen allows users to browse
through various items like mascara, eyeshadow palettes, powder canisters, and lipsticks.  
The screen provides all the necessary information to make informed purchasing decisions, including
current prices, discounts, and review ratings.
